# MERN-stack

I've created an average looking website using React, Node, Express js and Mongodb (MERN), allowing users to Sign Up, Login and perform CRUD operations. In this project I've focused on functionality and left the CSS part for now hoping to finish it later. Throughout this process I surely have learned at lot.
